                <p id="subject_matter"> 
                    I play a lot video games, and when I find a game with an amazing art style or story, or both, I cannot help but take some sort of inspiration from it.<br>
                    <br>
                    When I was only painting as a hobby, and had no intention to share my work with anyone else, I was just painting characters from the games I loved the most. <br>
                    <br>
                    I still enjoy doing that, and I know lots of other people like those pieces as well, but going forward, now that I am trying to share my art with the rest of the world, I have plans to make a lot more original works, with original characters who have their own stories

            <h3 id="my_intro"> MY INTRODUCTION TO ART </h3>
                <p id="intro2"> 
                    My mother used to love art, she was the most creative person I ever knew, and if I think back to what truly inspired me to start drawing and painting, it was watching and helping my mom with any kind of craft she was doing, and seeing how happy it made her.<br>
                    <br>
                    My sister and I definitely inherited her creativity and (somewhat) natural ability to draw and paint. But I definitely inherited my love for art from her.<br>
                    <br>
                    I remember looking up to my big sister when I was very young, because she was so good at drawing, and I would try so hard every day to practice my drawing because I wanted to be as good as her one day.<br>
                    <br>
                    It took me a little longer to hone my skills and find my style than it did for my sister, but I really started to notice my skill improving a lot by the time I was about 16/17. I decided to take art as a subject in high school, despite not really believing I was good enough at it to compare with the amazing artists in my school, but I quickly learnt not to compare myself to other artists, and rather to look at them for inspiration, and I found my marks improving from 50%/60% to my final matric mark of 97%. <br>
                    <br>
                    But marks are not everything, I really enjoy painting and drawing, it gives me a sense of fulfillment when I complete a piece that has taken a lot of work and time, and when I can make other people happy with my art, that is the most fulfilling.
                </p>

        </div>

        <div id="mdium">

            <h4 id="medium"> MY ART STYLE AND MEDIUMS </h4>
                <p id="art_style"> My art style and chosen mediums have changed and developed a lot over the years. I started with only drawing with pencils, and tried to go for a semi-realistic style, meaning that I would try get the shapes and shading as close to realistically accurate as possible. However it took a very long time before I had developed my skill enough to get that right. Eventually my style with pencils developed enough where I was able to accurately draw shapes, and my shading technique improved dramatically to a point where I was able to draw semi-realistic pieces.<br>
                    <br>
                    I do not draw with pencil as much as I used to, once my skill improved enough, I decided to risk painting. It took a long time for me to get into painting properly, as paint, canvases and brushes are all much more expensive than pencils, but when I really put myself into it, I found I enjoyed it much more than pencils because it I love working with colour.<br>
                    <br>   
                    One of the reasons I enjoy painting characters from video games is that some of my favourite games have amazing art styles, and I like to take those styles as inspiration to change and improve my own style. A lot of my works are not painted in the same style because of the fact that I do take the art style of the video game as inspiration.<br>
                    <br>   
                    This is one of the reasons why I am looking forward to trying to paint more original pieces, it will give me an opportunity to really develop my own art style.<br>
                    <br>   
                    At the moment I am only working in pencil and acrylic paint, but I hope to start trying to make sculptures one day, and I am really excited to try that.
